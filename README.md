# StableRecon: Making Video to 3D easy
Our code is currently undergoing refactoring and will be released by October 25th. In the meantime, we invite you to explore our demo on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Stable-X/StableRecon).

If you'd like to deploy the application locally, we recommend cloning the Hugging Face repository directly by running:

```
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/Stable-X/StableSpann3R.git
```

Please note that the demo code currently integrates both Spanner3r and our reconstruction code, which may make it challenging to run and experiment with. We're working on improving this for the final release.
